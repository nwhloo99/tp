**PlaceBook (PB) is a desktop app for managing contacts and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).** If you can type fast, PB can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
